# OreoOrnament

Project was set up using CubeMX, and created in Keil uVision5. Code for manipulating HSV was borrowed from [a hackaday post](https://hackaday.com/2018/06/18/buttery-smooth-fades-with-the-power-of-hsv/). Code for interfacing with APA102s is contained in main, and code for advancing each display mode is in its own file. Programming port on board uses a TC2030-IDC-NL (tag connect 6 pin port). Git ignore file was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/mrshrdlu/gitignore-keil).
